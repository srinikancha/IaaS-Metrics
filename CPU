fields:
======
time_user : CPU utilization time that occurred while executing at the user level (application).

time_system : CPU utilization time that occurred while executing at the system level (kernel). 

time_idle : The number of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle and the system did not have an outstanding disk I/O request. 

time_active: The number of times TCP connections have made a direct transition to the SYN-SENT state from the CLOSED state per second [tcpActiveOpens].

time_nice : CPU utilization time that occurred while executing at the user level with nice priority

time_iowait : The number of times that the CPU or CPUs were idle during which the system had an outstanding disk I/O request.

time_irq : The number of times spent by the CPU or CPUs to service hardware interrupts

time_softirq : The number of times spent by the CPU or CPUs to service software interrupts

time_steal : The number of times spent in involuntary wait by the virtual CPU or CPUs while the hypervisor was servicing another virtual processor.

time_guest : The number of times spent by the CPU or CPUs to run a virtual processor.

time_guest_nice : The number of times spent by the CPU or CPUs to run a virtual processor with nice priority

usage_user : Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the user level (application).

usage_system : Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the system level (kernel). 

usage_idle : Percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle and the system did not have an outstanding disk I/O request. 

usage_active : Percentage of times TCP connections have made a direct transition to the SYN-SENT state from the CLOSED state per second [tcpActiveOpens].

usage_nice :  Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the user level with nice priority 

usage_iowait : Percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle during which the system had an outstanding disk I/O request. 

usage_irq : Percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to service hardware interrupts

usage_softirq : Percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to service software interrupts

usage_steal : Percentage of time spent in involuntary wait by the virtual CPU or CPUs while the hypervisor was servicing another virtual processor.

usage_guest :  Percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to run a virtual processor. 

usage_guest_nice : Percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to run a virtual processor with nice priority
