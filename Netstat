Below are the feilds under [[netstat]] plugin

fields
=====

tcp_close
tcp_close_wait
tcp_closing
tcp_established
tcp_fin_wait1
tcp_fin_wait2
tcp_last_ack
tcp_listen
tcp_none
tcp_syn_recv
tcp_syn_sent
tcp_time_wait
udp_socket   



tcp_close - The socket is not being used
tcp_close_wait - The remote end has shutdown, waiting for the socket to close
tcp_closing - Both sockets are shutdown but we still don't have all out data sent 
tcp_established - The socket has an established connection
tcp_fin_wait1 - The socket is closed, and the connection is shutting down 
tcp_fin_wait2 - Connection is closed, and the socket is waiting for a shutdown from the remote end
tcp_last_ack - The remote end has shutdown, and the socket is closed, waiting for the acknowledgement
tcp_listen - The socket is listening for incomming connections
tcp_syn_recv - A connection request has been received from the network
tcp_syn_sent - The socket is actively attempting to establish a connection
tcp_time_wait - The Socket is waiting after close to handle packets still in the network 
udp_socket  - Open UDP sockets
