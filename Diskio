reads/writes :These values increment when an I/O request completes

read_bytes/write_bytes : These values count the number of bytes read from or written to this block device

read_time/write_time : Number of milliseconds that I/O requests have waited on this block device.If there are multiple I/O requests waiting, these values will increase at a rate greater than 1000/second; for example, if 60 read requests wait for an average of 30 ms, the read_time field will increase by 60*30 = 1800.

io_time : number of milliseconds during which the device has had I/O requests queued

weighted_io_time : number of milliseconds that I/O requests have waited on this block device. If there are multiple I/O requests waiting, this value will increase as the product of the number of milliseconds times the number of requests waiting 

iops_in_progress : The number of I/O requests that have been issued to the device driver but have not yet completed. It does not include I/O requests that are in the queue but not yet issued to the device driver.

merged_reads/merged_writes :Reads and writes which are adjacent to each other may be merged for efficiency. Thus two 4K reads may become one 8K read before it is ultimately handed to the disk, and so it will be counted (and queued) as only one I/O. These fields lets you know how often this was done.
