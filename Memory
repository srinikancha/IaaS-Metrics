active : Memory used recently. It’s not reclaimed unless absolutely necessary

available : Available memory is the amount of memory which is available for allocation to a new process or to existing processes or for a new workload, without pushing the system into swap, can be estimated from MemFree,Active(file), Inactive(file), and SReclaimable, and subtract the low watermarks from /proc/zoneinfo.

available_percent : Available memory in percent 

buffered : The amount of memory used as buffers, This can be released quickly by the kernel if required ( For example if a file of 2GB in size if we try to read the 2GB load in to the cache and meta data information load in to the buffer)

cached : Amount of memory used for cache, This can be released quickly by the kernel if required.

commit_limit : Based on the overcommit ratio(vm.overcommit_ratio) this is the total amount memory currently available to be allocated on the system  commit limit calculated as  (vm.overcommit_ratio * Physical RAM)+ Swap 

committed_as : The amount of memory presently allocated on the VM, The commited memory is a sum of all the memory which has been allocated by processes even if it has not been "used" by then as of yet

dirty : Amount of memory waiting to be written back to the disk

free : The amount of unused memory

high_free : Amount of free HighMem wich we can see from /proc/zoneinfo

high_total : Amount of total HighMem wich we can see from /proc/zoneinfo
 
huge_pages_free : Number of unallocated huge pages in the pool

huge_page_size : Size of huge pages

huge_pages_total : Huge page pool size

inactive : Pagecache memory that can be reclaimed without huge performance impact
 
laundry : Memory in process of flushing the modifications to the disk 

low_free : Amount of free LowMem from /proc/zoneinfo

low_total : Amount of total LowMem from /proc/zoneinfo

page_tables : Page-table is a data structure that helps a hardware circuit call the MMU(Memeory management Unit) to translate virtual address to physical address 

shared : Amount of memory used by the tmpfs file systems 

slab  : In-kernel data structures cache. pages used by the kernel memory pool

sreclaimable : Amount of Slab memory that might be reclaimed, such as caches

sunreclaim : Amount of Slab memory that can’t be reclaimed. 

swap_cached : Memory that was swapped out and back in, and a copy remains in the swap space.

swap_free : Amount of swap space that’s currently unused.

swap_total : Total amount of swap space available.

total : The total amount of physical RAM on the VM

used : The sum of Free+Buffers+Cache subtracted from the total amount.

used_percent : used memory in percentage

vmalloc_chunk : Largest contiguous block of free vmalloc area

vmalloc_total : Total size of the vmalloc memory area.

vmalloc_used : Amount of vmalloc area used. Since Linux 4.4, this field is no longer calculated, it’s hard-coded.

write_back : Memory actively being written back to the disk

write_back_tmp : Memory used by Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) for temporary write-back buffers.
